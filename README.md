##  MCC

The *MCC* package is designed to create a master catalog from a set of
independently created, uncorrelated catalogs.  For *N* unique objects in the set
of *M* catalogs, the master catalog will create a master catalog of size *N* as
well as *M* other extensions of size *N*.  The master catalog is stored in a
python pickle file with the extension ".mcc".  The *MCC* package also has a set
of tools to assist with batch, *SExtractor* runs as well as useful stamp
plotting routines.

##  The Terminal and Configuration File

The key routines of *MCC* may be run from the command line using the *mcc*
command followed by the command desired and necessary flags.
```
mcc <command> -<key> <value> -<key> <value>
```

A configuration file is needed in order to operate *MCC* from the command line,
although none of the *MCC* routines require this when operating from within a
python shell.
```
#<  name        <U16
#<  catalog     <U18
#<  image       <U18
#<  Rc          float64
#<  append      <U6

GALEX_FUV             GALEX_FUV.cat         GALEX_FUV.1.fits       1.50   True
GALEX_FUV             GALEX_FUV.cat         GALEX_FUV.2.fits       1.50   True
GALEX_FUV             GALEX_FUV.cat         GALEX_FUV.3.fits       1.50   True
GALEX_FUV             GALEX_FUV.cat         GALEX_FUV.4.fits       1.50   True

GALEX_NUV             GALEX_NUV.cat         GALEX_NUV.1.fits       1.50   True
GALEX_NUV             GALEX_NUV.cat         GALEX_NUV.2.fits       1.50   True
GALEX_NUV             GALEX_NUV.cat         GALEX_NUV.3.fits       1.50   True
GALEX_NUV             GALEX_NUV.cat         GALEX_NUV.4.fits       1.50   True

MEGAPRIME_u           MEGAPRIME_u.cat       MEGAPRIME_u.fits       0.50   True
MEGAPRIME_g           MEGAPRIME_g.cat       MEGAPRIME_g.fits       0.50   True

z_VISTA               zVista.cat            None                   0.50   False
```
The top lines starting with `#<` indicate the line as a column format (see
*Io/README.md*).  The column definitions are indicated by this header. One thing
to notice is that the extension `GALEX_FUV` has multiple rows, only differing in
the image name.  This is the way to indicate to *MCC* that multiple images are
associated with this extension.  The column definitions are as follows:

*   name    -   name of the extension in the master
*   catalog -   name of the catalog ascii file
*   image   -   name of an image associated with the extension
*   Rc      -   correlation radius [arcsec] used in correlation
*   append  -   boolean to indicate whether or not to add unmatched objects

Any lines starting with `#` will be ignored from the configurations file.

##  Creating a Master Catalog

The *MCC* command `create` is used to create a master catalog from the configs
file as well as the existing catalogs in ASCII format.
```
mcc create -mcc Field.mcc -cfg Field.cfg -path Catalogs
```

Flags:
*   -mcc    master catalog pickle file to create
*   -cfg    configurations file
*   -path   path to the input catalog files ("." by default)

##  Adding and Correlating a New Catalog

The *MCC* command `add` is used to correlate and add a new catalog to an
existing master catalog.  This may only be done with the pickle file.
```
mcc add -mcc Field.mcc -cat MEGAPRIME_u -cfg Field.cfg -path Catalogs
```

Flags:
*   -mcc    existing master catalog pickle file
*   -cfg    configurations file
*   -path   path to the input catalog files ("." by default)
*   -cat    name of the catalog to add (name as listed in the configs file)

##  Writing an ASCII from an Extension

The *MCC* command `write` is used to write a formatted ASCII file from an
extension within the master.  The master extension is indicated by "master"
(not case sensitive).
```
mcc write -mcc Field.mcc -cat MEGAPRIME_u -ascii MEGAPRIME_u.cat
```

Flags:
*   -mcc    existing master catalog pickle file
*   -cat    name of the catalog to write
*   -ascii  name of the output ASCII file

##  Writing a FITS Master Catalog

The *MCC* command `write_fits` creates a FITS cube with the same basic structure
as the pickle file.
```
mcc write_fits -Field.mcc -fits Field.fits -clobber False
```

Flags:
*   -mcc        existing master catalog pickle file
*   -fits       name of the FITS file to write the master to
*   -clobber    if "True", it will overwrite an existing FITS file

##  Using MCC in a Python Shell

The main actor in the MCC package is the class `Master`.  The class `Master`
defines the Master Catalog Object.  An instantiation of the class has the
following members:

*   *file_name*     - the file name for which the object is written to and
    opened from
*   *N*             - the number of unique objects in the master catalog
*   *master*        - the master catalog array extension (described below)
*   *cat_list*      - a list of all extensions added to the master catalog
*   *catalogs*      - a dictionary of the input catalog extensions
*   *images*        - a dictionary where each element contains a list of image
    filenames associated with each input catalog
*   *Rc*            - a dictionary of the correlation radii used for each input
    catalog

The `Master` class contains the following methods, the description of each is
described by the docstring:

*   save( saveas=None, clobber=False )
*   open( file_name )
*   write( cat_name, file_name )
*   write_fits( file_name, clobber=False )
*   append( cat_name, catalog, Rc=1, images=None )
*   update()
*   add_catalog( cat_name, catalog, Rc, append=True, images=None )
*   test_coverage( cat, data_dir=None )

Once the Master Catalog has been created, it's usage is described below:

```python
##  import the MCC and Io packages

In [1]: import MCC, Io

##  instantiate a master catalog object from an existing .mcc file

In [2]: MC = MCC.Master( "Test.mcc" )

##  print some of the members

In [3]: print( MC.N )
46177

In [4]: print( MC.cat_list )
['GALEX_FUV', 'GALEX_NUV', 'MEGAPRIME_u']

##  retrieve one of the catalog extensions
##  print it's dtype (column format)
##  print a column of the array and its 256th value

In [5]: data = MC.catalogs["GALEX_FUV"]

In [7]: print( data.dtype )
[('id', '<i8'), ('alpha', '<f8'), ('delta', '<f8'), ('x', '<f8'), ('y', '<f8'), ('flux', '<f8'), ('dflux', '<f8'), ('mag', '<f8'), ('dmag', '<f8'), ('a', '<f8'), ('b', '<f8'), ('theta', '<f8'), ('ellpiticity', '<f8'), ('fwhm', '<f8'), ('radius_f', '<f8'), ('radius_k', '<f8'), ('background', '<f8'), ('threshold', '<f8'), ('flags', '<i4'), ('class', '<f8')]

In [8]: print( data["alpha"] )
[ 150.340235  150.464152  150.394956 ...,  -99.        -99.        -99.      ]

In [9]: print( data["alpha"][256] )
150.340235

##  write an extension to an ascii array

In [10]: MC.write( "GALEX_FUV", "Test.cat" )

##  write the entire master catalog to a FITS file
##  because FITS files are annoying, it will have trouble with the header

In [11]: MC.write_fits( "Test.fits", clobber=True )
WARNING: VerifyWarning: Keyword name 'FILE_NAME' is greater than 8 characters or contains characters not allowed by the FITS standard; a HIERARCH card will be created. [astropy.io.fits.card]
